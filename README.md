# boss_fight_game
A game about just fighting bosses 

Lorewise bosses are strong and huge unknown life forms (I will call them "aliens" from no on) that emits a strange energy 
and player has to use specifically developped devices that's using 
the strange energy as it's power source to neutralise or completely destroy those aliens

## In development:
-Player Character: The Core

    A green sphere like life form. It was the first alien to appear. 
    It has pretty simple attack pattern. Rapidly shoots big, relatively slow moving spheres.
    
"Should be easy to deal with."

-Boss: The Cube:

    An artefact that was found in the deepest hole of the world. It automatically activates itself when near an alien and     
    turns into a suit that an operator can use. 
    It can't attack or doesn't have a special attack. 
    It is really easy to repair (it can self repair to some degree) but is extremely fragile. Operators advised to avoid getting hit by aliens at all cost.
    For some reason aliens neutralise themselves after a certain period of time passes when The Cube is near them. Reasons unknown.

"I wonder how it was created."

-Menus

    For now, we don't have a GUI to plan deployment and/or select equipment for the mission. Will be added. Probably.

## Planned to develop:
-PC: "Sheffy"

    A female, blonde, british, maid created to fight aliens.
    She has high movement speed and can dodge quickly for longer distances.
    *Weapon information is confidential for now.*
    Can only be deployed near water (oceans or seas).
    Has a battle cruiser nearby. It is modified to damage aliens. But it's reload time is significantly increased.

"Why a maid? This is too specific to be not a fetish. lol"

-Boss: "Takeshi"

    Detected by an operator called Takeshi. He decided to give it his own name and management agreed. They both said "for shits and giggles." *sigh*
    A humanoid alien that has ability to close-in without moving it's energy core. Can move vertically.
    Has strong melee attacks and weak but fast moving projectiles.
    It has an outer armor. Looks like a samurai armor. Details unknown.

"Samurai aliens? Hell yeah!"
